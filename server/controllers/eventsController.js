When there is lack of awareness on the breath, a challenging posture creates exhaustion and mental instability, and more times than not we end up more fragmented than when we came in, feeling better only momentarily because of increased endorphins and sweat.\nNot only breathing does matter in yoga, but we have the ability to transform the energetics of our body and our mind thru proper adaptation of the breath, which will help us to feel steady and ready for pranayama techniques that will eventually lead us to meditation.\nObjective: At the end of the workshop, participants will understand how to adapt the breath not only to move optimally into a posture, but also to unfold prana and the release of our greatest potential.\nSYLLABUS:\n\nIntroduction to Breath Adaptation\nElements of the Breath.

Your mind and body have built-in healing responses that are just as powerful as their protective pain-and-stress responses. Whether it’s a meditation on gratitude, a relaxation pose that puts the body and mind at ease, or a breathing exercise that strengthens the flow of energy in your body—they all share the benefit of bringing you back home to your natural sense of well-being.  \nRestorative yoga turns on the healing relaxation response by combining gentle yoga poses with conscious breathing.\nAlthough these poses may look as though you are doing nothing, this is far from the truth. Restorative yoga rests the body but engages the mind. The breathing elements of each pose make restorative yoga an active process of focusing the mind on healing thoughts, sensations, and emotions.",
