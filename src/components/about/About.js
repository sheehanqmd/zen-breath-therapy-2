                    <h6>Developing good habits during the day that promote a healthy intake of oxygen can often set you up for success when it’s time to fall asleep.
               During sleep, you need to be breathing well enough to ensure your blood is adequately saturated with oxygen.
               Quality, deep breathing while you sleep provides cells and tissues with a sufficient amount of 
               oxygen to function properly.</h6>

                    <h5>The circuit is part of what's been called the brain’s “breathing pacemaker” because it can be adjusted by 
                        altering breathing rhythm (slow, controlled breathing decreases activity in the circuit; fast, erratic breathing increases activity), 
                        which in turn influences emotional states.</h5>

                    <p>When a person is relaxed, they breathe through their nose in a slow, even and gentle way.
                       Deliberately copying a relaxed breathing pattern seems to calm the 
                       nervous system that controls the body’s involuntary functions. 
                       Controlled breathing can cause physiological changes that include reduced levels of stress hormones in the blood.</p>
